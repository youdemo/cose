# Privacy Policy for COSE - 多平台文章同步

**Last Updated: December 5, 2025**

## Overview

COSE (Create Once, Sync Everywhere) is a browser extension that helps users sync articles from the md.doocs.org Markdown editor to multiple publishing platforms. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

COSE operates entirely locally within your browser. The extension:

- Does **NOT** collect personally identifiable information
- Does **NOT** collect health, financial, or authentication information
- Does **NOT** track your browsing history or web activity
- Does **NOT** send any data to external servers
- Does **NOT** use analytics or tracking services

## Data Usage

All data processed by COSE remains on your local device:

- **Article Content**: Your article title, body, and formatting are only read from md.doocs.org and transferred directly to the target publishing platforms within your browser.
- **Login Status**: The extension checks login cookies on target platforms (CSDN, Juejin, WeChat, etc.) solely to verify if you are logged in. This information is not stored or transmitted.
- **User Preferences**: Any settings are stored locally using Chrome's storage API and never leave your device.

## Permissions Explained

- And other supported platforms

These interactions are solely for the purpose of publishing your content. We have no control over the privacy practices of these platforms.
